# ABOUT THE PROJECT
{: .text-primary }

Vivirconvih.org is an initiative of the [Project about Organization, Development, Education and Research (PODER)](https://www.projectpoder.org/), using data from the [Legal Network](http://redlegalysuobservatorio.com.gt/), and the [International Treatment Preparedness Coalition (ITPC)](http://itpclatca.org/), the data analogic visualizations of Briseida Millián Lemus, and [Hivos](https://www.hivos.org/) company.

All the site information is based on the following documents:

- [ITPC Guatemalan Open Data and HIV Study 2017 and its database of ARV acquisitions in Guatemala 2017](http://itpclatca.org/datos-abiertos/). 
- [1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th national report on the human rights situation of AIDS patients and higher risk population](http://redlegalysuobservatorio.com.gt/documentos). 
- [Reports from the Monitoreo Ciudadano de Hivos project](http://hivos.org.gt/monitoreo-ciudadano/). 
- [The antiretroviral contracting by the Guatemalan Ministry of Public Health and Social Assistance (MSPAS) between 2011 and 2018 piled and systematized by PODER through Guatecompras and information petitions (download CSV)](assets/data/Compras_ARV-GT-MSPAS_2011-18.csv).

This project would not have been possible without Hivos team support, the PODER team data-entry and analysis, and citizens who have selflessly collaborated with us with the sole objective of improving the Guatemalan healthcare system.
