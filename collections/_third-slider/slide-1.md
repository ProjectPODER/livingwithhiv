# COST PROJECTION DISCREPANCIES

Guatemala, May 3, 2008, 11th Avenue. The constitutional court passes sentence on the failure of public health institutions: 11 constitutional lawsuits (Amparo) had to be carried out for Guatemalans to have access to their legitimate right to health.

Justice has been neither quick nor effective, as actions have taken longer than a person should wait to be attended. The Guatemalan human rights Ombudsperson  of that time, Jorge de Le√≥n Duque, had predicted a short term "lack of basic medical care and supplies to control the virus." His intervention helped as a record on the trial before the Court.
