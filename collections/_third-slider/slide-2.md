# SUING TO SURVIVE

In total, there were 11 constitutional lawsuits, where 81% of plaintiffs, despite being affiliated to the Guatemalan Institute of Social Security (IGSS), could not access healthcare.

Note that during the timespan analyzed (2002 to 2014), using the Legal Network and its Observatory for Human Rights, HIV and PEMAR, most cases won in Court were promoted by the own Guatemalan human rights Ombudsman. When these belonged to an organized civil society or individuals, the court ruled against them.
