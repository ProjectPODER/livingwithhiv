# SHORTAGE RED CIRCLE

IGSS clinic located in zone 9 of the capital is the weakest link of a chain that seems to be about to break. During 2017 alone, this clinic received 35 reports from affiliates who complained about antiretroviral medicine shortage during more than 25 successive days.

Combinations of NRTIs are the scarcest medications. Commercially known as Truvada, this antiretroviral was requested over 35 times by patients, but medical services could not provide it.
