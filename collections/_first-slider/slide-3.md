# MORE INGREDIENTS, LESS TABLETS

In 2017, the number of tablets each patient had to take began to decrease significantly, as pharmaceutical companies started to transition from single to compound formulas. For example, different combinations with Didanosina (DDI) are replaced by Lamivudine/Zidovudine or Abacavir/Lamivudine combined into a single daily tablet, depending on clinical judgment.

Another Capsule of combined medicines example is the Atripla, which contains Tenofovir, Emtricitabine and Efavirenz, according to the Health Ministry's public procurement system, based on purchases to the Global Fund, PAHO and other clinical labs.
