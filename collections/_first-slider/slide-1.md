# TREATMENT PLANS

Guatemala currently has three HIV therapy treatment plans, based on standards and recommendations by the WHO (World Health Organization), and each line needs a different antiretroviral combination. Beyond third line, there is no treatment available in Guatemala.

Three months of shortage will cause a virus mutation, requiring a treatment plan change to treat it. Some opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, or toxoplasmosis may arise during this period.
