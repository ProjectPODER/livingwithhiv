# PROCUREMENT CONSOLIDATION AND THERAPY CATEGORIES

Medicine purchases are made by the MSPAS using five contract types, which does not always provide the ideal conditions for fair competition between companies. The highest number of procurements in Guatemala are done through international agreements, and the lowest are done under the Low Amount Purchases mode (little market stock).

Therapy is aimed at the greatest number of HIV-positive people: young men from 20 to 25 years old who have been mostly diagnosed in Guatemala City. Illiteracy also represents a big factor of risk, as 1,846 cases come from people who cannot read or write. Lastly, the most recent AIDS Epidemiological Surveillance Report released by the MSPAS states that at the moment it was published, there were 949 people with an advanced stage of viral load: 243 women and 706 men.
