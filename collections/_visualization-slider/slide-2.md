# MSPAS PURCHASES

In this exercise, we have looked at all the purchases made between 2011 and 2018 by the Guatemalan Ministry of Public Health and Social Assistance (MSPAS), including purchases by the Global Fund, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and those complementary purchases made by private laboratories in order to satisfy specific demands.

In total, there are 297 antiretroviral procurement contracts corresponding to more than 167 million quetzales. If the shortage problem is not solved in the short-term, the amount required by the country to solve this issue will raise significantly, as more people will be infected by then.
