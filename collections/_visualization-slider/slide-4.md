# DUOPOLY AND PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS

MSPAS has an agreement signed with the PAHO since 2017, and from 2011 to 2016 had another agreement with the Global Fund. These two organizations totally controlled the sales of antiretrovirals in Guatemala.

Purchases were made through this mechanism for a value of 86 million quetzales. The rest of acquisitions are divided between private individuals. The companies that were awarded the most contracts were Solmedica S.A, Amicelo S.A, Importer and Marketer RR S.A and Advanced Medicines. In total, these four managed to sell 5,752,414 quetzales in 33 contracts.
