# CONTRACTS

"How was your family before the diagnosis?" With these seven words and a black microphone in front of her, Soyla Marina PÃ©rez, from the Sintana Quetzal Community in Guatemala, burst into tears before the international Court. This question, that spilled nostalgia down her cheeks, came up in one of the most important trials in the history of the worst Guatemalan public health epidemic the Guatemalan Ministry of Public Health and Social Assistance (MSPAS) had ever dealt with, the AIDS epidemic.

Soyla found out she was HIV-positive the same day she heard about the disease existence. None of her children could complete beyond sixth grade, all of them had to drop out school as they needed to support their parents. Her husband, also infected and in worse health conditions, could not face the catastrophe alone. Soyla's case is one more in the long list of people who live with HIV and whose life depend on an appropriate, transparent and humane contracting system. This pandemic thrives in countries where medicine is scarce.
