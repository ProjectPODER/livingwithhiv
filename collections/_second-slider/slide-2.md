# 17 MILLION QUETZALES OVERPRICE

In 2017, Guatemala lost over 17 million quetzales in overpriced procurements, 92% of which was due to output limitation such as copyright or company data protection. This is explained by the Social Audit of the Procurement of Antiretroviral Medicine, drawn up by the International Treatment Preparedness Coalition (ITPC).

The investigation revealed that in 2017, the state paid 39,230,099.66 quetzales (Q) for antiretroviral drugs, but according to ITPC, they could have been purchased for Q 21,807,984.24. This means that 17 million quetzales could have been saved if there were no legal barriers.
