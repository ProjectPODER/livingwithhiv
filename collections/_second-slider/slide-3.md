# LEGAL BARRIERS CAUSE OVERPRICING

Ideally, International Treaties and Agreements help to cut costs, but legal barriers such as patents may offset these benefits.

One of the best examples is the Lopinavir/Ritonavir combination, which has been the medication with the most money invested in: Q 72,000,000 since 2011. This is a crucial medicine to treat AIDS as it works for all three therapy lines. Besides, it is essential to keep pregnant women from transmitting the virus to their children. The drug is no longer patent-protected in most countries, but still is in Guatemala.
